[INTRO]
(FADE IN):INT. STREETS OF WIENINGTON
A man walks onto screen. He stands on a crate placed in the crowded streets. People argue back and forth, protesting. 
Guns fire off. People scream. The man starts.
[Casey] /Narration\
After 21 years of fighting, shame, you learn you can't control whose lighting the flame. What's the spark or that will to go on? 
/People stop to look up at Casey\ 
[Casey]
Let me finish here, we need to go farther! We need to go farther! Let's go even farther than before. 
Sacrifice the soldiers, citizens, and resources? Damn, are we sure? What's it all for? 
If we stand for nothing, what do we fall for?
[Casey] (CHOROUS)
Honored soldiers die. (What?) Grieving widows cry. (What?) We must say goodbye. (No.) No one knows why. 
(Why Why Why Why? Why Why Why Why?) Many rebels fell. (Why Why Why Why?) For the revolution. (Die Die Die Die.) 
No one can tell.(No one can tell. No one can tell.) Why can't anybody tell? Why must we go
[CHOUROUS]
Farther? We need to go farther! Let's go past the line! I am theirs and they are mine. Many people died. (Why?) We all____ cry.
(For what?) For the revolution! (For what?) For the revolution! (For what? For what?) For the revolution!
[Casey]
I'm Casey Barton and I died for the revolution and I know the war's confusing, but believe me, I've got a solution to fix the
state of our nation. The wild inflation, damn it's giving me frustration. But we need to create a formation to base the foundation
of the narration! It's all for the revolution! Humanity's been through evolution, we will not suffer another execution! 
We will fight till we're free!
[CHOROUS]
For what? For what? For what? For the revolution!
